# UVisExplore: Uncertainty Visualization Tool for Tumor Resection Surgery

![UVisExplore](./assets/UncertaintyVis.png)

UVisExplore is a comprehensive uncertainty visualization software designed to assist neurosurgeons during brain tumor resection surgeries. The tool enables both qualitative and quantitative exploration of various uncertainty visualization methods, focusing on enhancing decision-making while minimizing the cognitive load in the complex surgical environment.

## Challenges in Brain Surgery

One of the significant challenges during brain tumor resection is brain shiftâ€”the dynamic and non-rigid deformation of the brain caused by various factors such as head position, fluid levels, and tissue resection. Brain shift can invalidate the alignment between preoperative images and the patient's brain during surgery, introducing uncertainty into the surgical process. UVisExplore addresses these challenges by providing advanced visualization techniques that help surgeons understand and manage this uncertainty, ensuring safer and more effective surgeries.

## Features

* **Color Overlay:** A customizable color map that encodes uncertainty directly on the MRI images. Surgeons can adjust the color scheme, overlay opacity, and threshold to focus on areas of interest without obscuring important details.
* **Surgeon-Centric Visualization:** Focuses on uncertainty visualization at the tip of the surgical instrument. Modes include:
  * **Audio Warning:** Alerts when entering/exiting high-uncertainty regions.
  * **Color Overlay Flicker:** Visual feedback when moving into high-uncertainty areas.
  * **Text Overlay:** Displays uncertainty values directly at the instrument tip.
  * **Localized Color Map:** Visualizes uncertainty around the instrument tip.
* **Tumor-Based Visualization:** Visualizes the uncertainty at the tumor boundary using minimum and maximum offset volumes to indicate the possible extent of the tumor.

## Game for Training and Evaluation

Surgery requires careful evaluation of new tools. To support this, UVisExplore includes a game-based approach that serves as both a training tool and a decision-making simulation. This helps surgeons understand uncertainty visualization and see its impact in a safe environment.

### Game Structure

The game has two levels:
* **Training Level:** Players can see the ground truth while performing tumor resections, helping them learn how uncertainty visualization affects outcomes.

* **Challenge Level:**
  * **Step 1: Without Visualization:** Players resect the tumor without any visualization, establishing a baseline.

  * **Step 2: With Visualization:** Players repeat the task with uncertainty visualization to compare effectiveness and see the results of their decisions.
