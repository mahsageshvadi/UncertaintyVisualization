# Welcome to Uncertainty Visualization Tool ðŸ‘‹

Interactive Platform for Visualizing Uncertainty in MRI Images in 3D slicer

![](UncertaintyVis.png)

With Uncertainty Visualization Tool  you can visualize uncertainty in medical images, helping during tumor resection surgeries. The tool offers four main features: Volume Filtering, Color Overlay, Surgeon-Centric, and Tumor-Based visualizations. Additionally, evaluate each technique through an interactive game designed to identify the most effective visualization.

## Features

- **Volume Filtering:** Filter volume data to highlight areas of interest.
- **Color Overlay:** Apply color overlays to visualize different uncertainty levels.
- **Surgeon-Centric:** Focus on the surgeon's perspective for critical decision-making.
- **Tumor-Based:** Tailor visualizations based on tumor characteristics.

## Installation
